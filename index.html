    <h1>YOU SURVIVED FOUR TRUTHS AND A LIE!</h1>
    <h2>I would say congratulations, but let's be honest, you probably cheated.</h2>
    <h3>Anyway, I promised some stuff, so here it is:</h3>
    <p>I really have been in a Chinook with my dog (as well as a blackhawk, and a C-130), I really have been to 46/50 states (I haven't been to Florida, Maine, Michigan, or Ohio), I really <strong>haven't</strong> been to the Grand Canyon (but you can check out the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/grand-canyon.htm">here</a>), I really did total a truck on a grizzly bear in Canada one time (outside of Destruction Bay in the Yukon Territory, and I had to hitchhike home), and I actually did catch a 40lb king (Chinook) salmoon fishing in Alaska, and had to hike out from the creek with it (luckily they weight less after they've been gutted).</p>
    <p>I hope you've enjoyed your journey through a few of my Alaska and travel related experiences, below are a few pictures for you to enjoy!</p>

    <p>Here is me with my 40lb King salmon, that I caught in Montana Creek (don't be fooled, the creek is outside of Talkeetna, Alaska).</p>

    <p>Here is me on a glacier on Denali, in front of a retrofitted deHavilland Otter bush plane on wheelskis, while I was working for one of only four companies in the US that can land fixed wing airplanes on glaciers, in the only place in the US they can.</p>

    <p>Here is my totaled truck, and my black Alaskan husky, Asha, after hitting a grizzly bear in Canada. We hitchhiked home together.</p>
